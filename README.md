The project could cover most of the essential features of a typical vehicle service provider plus some special features. But it does not handle financial details of the company and online payments in this stage. Even the supplier details are maintained (add/ update/ delete) by the management of the company, suppliers are not allowed to view the status of their vehicles and so on. In the same way, drivers are not given the opportunity to online inform the company whenever a journey is completed so that the vehicle can be assigned for another journey without delaying.     

I believe that the work carried out here is valuable and can be extended by including relevant modules in the future.
