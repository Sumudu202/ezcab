The template covers most of the essential features of a typical vehicle service provider plus some special features. It does not handle financial details of the company and online payments in this stage. The supplier details are maintained (add/ update/ delete) by the management of the company, however the suppliers are not allowed to view the status of their vehicles and so on.     

This template is ready to use and easy to customise by including relevant modules as required.
